adventurer cards
----------------
Draws cards until two treasure cards are drawn
Tracks whether the drawn card is cooper, silver or gold and increments drawntreasure when the drawn card is one of the three
If the card is not a treasure card then it decrements the overall handcount for the player and increases the count of cards that has been drawn.
Functionally speaking, it keeps track of a temporary hand that each drawn card is added to, presumably to be displayed separately.
Nothing is actually done with the temporary hand once two treasures are drawn so the cards are placed back into the player's discard pile via state->discard.

smithy cards
----------------
Draws additional 3 cards, adding them to the current player's hand. Once the cards are drawn via drawCard, the discardCard function is called and all the player's
cards are discarded.
