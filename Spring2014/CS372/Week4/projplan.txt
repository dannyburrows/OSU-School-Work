Project Plan - Implemented in Python (or C, I have not fully decided as of yet)

Psuedo Code
------------

Client:

Import sockets library
Accept command line parameters
Parse CLI args
Create a socket connection
Pass port to socket connection
Recieve input from host
Close socket connection
Display the information

Server:

Import sockets library
Accept and parse CLI args
Create a socket connection at specified port
loop:
	Wait for client to connect
	Receive request
	Send response
	Close connection


Explanation
------------

Client:
The client will accept CLI args for a host and a port, attempting to create a connection to the server at that socket. The actions passed to the client on the command line will be sent to the server, the server will process and send a response back to the client. The client will display either an error or a success message.


Server:
The server will be created at a specified port taken as a command line argument. When the server is started, it will wait for a connection from the client with a request. Once the request is received it will respond to the request and send the file requested (or other action such as list) back to the client.
